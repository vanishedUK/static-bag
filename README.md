# Static Bag
**GOAL**: Add static properties to the `Bag` class and create tests to verify their properties have been created.

## Directions
1. Modify your `Bag` class to add a static property to hold the maximum weight of a bag (23kg)
2. Write code to throw an exception if a bag is constructed with a weight greater than this maximum
3. Add tests to validate your logic
4. Save and commit work back to GitHub
